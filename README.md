# Data Science Portfolio

Portfolio showcasing some of my data science projects
 presented in iPython Notebooks.

## Contents
---------------------------------------

[Data cleaning: Nutritional Analysis part.1](https://github.com/NicolasRossignol/data-science_portfolio/blob/master/Nutritional_Data_Analysis_part1.ipynb):
This project uses the openfoodfacts online database and aims at assessing the nutritional values of food products sold in France. First part focuses on the cleaning process and the building of an operational dataset.

[EDA: Nutritional Analysis part.2](https://github.com/NicolasRossignol/data-science_portfolio/blob/master/Nutritional_Data_Analysis_part2.ipynb): The second part of the Nutritional Analysis project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis of the previously cleaned dataset. I notably show various plotting options of Python. (If Notebook doesn't render please try [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NicolasRossignol/data-science_portfolio/blob/master/Nutritional_Data_Analysis_part2.ipynb))

[Distances and categorical variables: Movie Recommendation](https://github.com/NicolasRossignol/data-science_portfolio/blob/master/Movie_recommendation/1.Movie_Recommendation.ipynb):
This project uses some data from IMDB website to build a simple recommendation algorithm returning a list of movies similar to the target. The project focuses on distance computation on categorical variables and on the use of data standardization and transformation.

[Clustering: Customer segmentation](https://github.com/NicolasRossignol/data-science_portfolio/blob/master/Customer_segmentation/Customer_Segmentation.ipynb):
This project uses the records of the purchases on an (imaginary) online shop to build a dataset describing customers and then to group customers into different clusters based on their buying habits.

[Supervised classification](https://github.com/NicolasRossignol/data-science_portfolio/blob/master/Customer_segmentation/ClassificationModel.ipynb):
Based on customer segments. Comparisons of performances between SVM, RandomForest and GradientBoosting classifiers. Use of pipelines and cross-validation procedures for accurate results.

[Regression: Predicting flight delays](https://github.com/NicolasRossignol/data-science_portfolio/blob/master/Flight_delays.ipynb):
This project uses data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to build a predictive model of flight delays. The model used is a Ridge regression model. Use of a composite pipeline to handle different pre-processing steps and cross-validation procedure. *Work in progress*
