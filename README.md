This project uses the openfoodfacts online database and aims at assessing the nutritional values of food products sold in France. First part focuses on the cleaning process and the building of an operational dataset.

[EDA: Nutritional Analysis part.2](https://github.com/NicolasRossignol/data-science_portfolio/blob/master/Nutritional_Data_Analysis_part2.ipynb): The second part of the Nutritional Analysis project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis of the previously cleaned dataset. I notably show various plotting options of Python.
